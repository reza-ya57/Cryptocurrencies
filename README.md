# Cryptocurrencies
## Project Description:
### In this study, we used a dataset of crypto currencies on the market and create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for any new investment.
## Method of Analysis:
### Since there is no known output for what we are looking for, I have decided to use unsupervised learning. To group the cryptocurrencies, I decided on a clustering algorithm and use data visualizations to share the findings.
### Before build a model I cleaned up the data first by using the PCA, elimination, reducing the dimenssion methods and convert string data to number.
## Summary:
### By study on the data I suggest to use 4 clusters for all cryptocurrencies on the trading market.
