It is the world's largest music streaming service providers, with over 356 million monthly active users, including 158 million paying subscribers, as of March 2021. In order to this high popularity we decided to build a model to analyse user's favorite song and suggest best relevant song based on user's interest, so this can expand users play list and increase active users in spotify platform. 
## Objective
### Design a model to review the users demmography and habitant to make a proper sugesstion and offer based on the users attitude

### In this project we are working on spotify dataset and collect the user's attribute, track attribute to run the analysis and build a model based on clustering method.
## Deliverable
### need to discuss in team
